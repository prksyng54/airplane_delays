## Airplane Delay Data Analysis and Visualization

In this project, we are analyzing the on-time statistics and delay causes of the U.S. domestic flight from July 2024 to July 2025. Our goal is two answer two key questions: 1) How do delay patterns vary across U.S. airports and states, and how are these patterns associated with geography, dominant delay types, and airport traffic volume? (2) Which delay type is most costly to the aviation system, and what are its underlying patterns and impacts. By examining five delay categories across major airports, we can identify systemic patterns as well as airport-specific challenges that could guide future operational improvements.
