    "text": "1 Introduction\nOn average, flight delays cost the U.S. economy $285 million and $580 million per day (FAA). It also affects 236 million travellers, almost 1 in 4 passengers, each year (Airhelp). To understand where and why these delays occur, we will analyse the on-time statistics and delay causes of U.S. domestic flights from January to June 2025. Our analysis will answer two key questions: (1) Do U.S. airports fall into distinct operational delay profiles, and what drives the differences between those profiles? (2) Which delay causes the greatest cost across the system? By examining five delay categories across major airlines and airports, we can identify systemic patterns as well as airport-specific challenges that could guide future operational improvements.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis data comes from the United States Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics and contains information on flight delays and cancellations for domestic flights in the first six months of 2025. In that time period, there were a total of 11,404 delayed operations by 21 airlines at 370 airports.\nEach observation represents aggregated monthly statistics for a specific airport-airline combination (i.e. HOU-Southwest-January or IAD-Delta-May). There are 21 variables representing flight volumes, delay counts, delay durations, cancellations and diversions. A flight is considered delayed if it arrives more than 15 minutes after its scheduled time.\nKey Delay Categories (each measured in both count and minutes):\nIt is important to note that the delay time and delay count metrics capture different aspects of performance; an airport could have many short delays (high count, low time) or a few very long delays (low count, high time), so both dimensions must be considered in the analysis. Additionally, because airports and airlines vary significantly in size, performance comparisons will need to be normalised by the total number of incoming flights to create meaningful per-flight delay rates.",
