# Conclusion

## Q1 Insights

Delay patterns across U.S. airports vary by geography, dominant delay type, and airport traffic volume. Late aircraft delays appeared the most in airports, whereas security delays are rare and seemed unrelated to other delay sources. There is no significant relationship between airport size and number of delays, in other words, larger airports do not necessarily have higher delay rates. However, smaller airports had greater variability and more extreme outliers. Western states generally show lower delay rates across all categories, while the Northeast and parts of the Midwest experience consistently higher delays for late-aircraft, weather, and NAS delays. It was interesting that West Virginia had extremely high delay rates for most of type, which is represented as an outlier and worth further investigation. Overall, geographic region and delay type contribute more to explaining delay differences than airport traffic volume alone.

## Q2 Insights

Late aircraft delays are the aviation system’s greatest operational vulnerability, combining high frequency with substantial duration to account for 40% of all delay minutes. Weather delays only account for 4% of all total delays, but when they do occur, they result in the highest average time per delay at an hour and 20 minutes. The strong seasonal increase during peak travel periods indicates that this problem intensifies under high demand rather than being constant throughout the year. Additionally, this pattern is prevalent across all airports regardless of their hub status. I learned that it's crucial to do a thorough analysis of the data before committing project direction. Our original approach with gtrends worked fine for simple plots, but when we tried to do more analytical comparisons and regional analyses, the data just wasn’t sufficient. Extending this data back a few years and comparing patterns before and after COVID could reveal whether the pandemic had any lasting impact on the aviation system. Another interesting direction would be to incorporate data about airport operational practices (differences in how airports are managed by city/municipal vs. port vs. independent authorities) to see if management approaches relate to delay patterns.
