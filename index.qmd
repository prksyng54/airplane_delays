# Introduction

On average, flight delays cost the U.S. economy \$285 million and \$580 million per day (FAA). It also affects 236 million travellers, almost 1 in 4 passengers, each year (Airhelp). To understand where and why these delays occur, we will analyse the on-time statistics and delay causes of U.S. domestic flights from January to June 2025. Our analysis will answer two key questions: (1) Do U.S. airports fall into distinct operational delay profiles, and what drives the differences between those profiles? (2) Which delay causes the greatest cost across the system? By examining five delay categories across major airlines and airports, we can identify systemic patterns as well as airport-specific challenges that could guide future operational improvements.
